Programming Language Shells

Basic Shells for various programming languages (Hello Worlds) that can be further modified for heavy implementation or design. These source codes are only to provide a starting shell like most IDE's would do. These were written to save time in writing mundane script definitions in order to start coding. Created by Kevin in 2016.
